# Portfolio
I'm a developer who loves programming and videogames. 

Right now im focused in the post-launch development for the game **Rise Top** launched in January 2021 for Android devices in the Play Store.

My portfolio will show you a bit of my skills. This will be the base repository and i will link here my Unity works and little projects.

## Works
#### [Infinite Rise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sacagama.risetothetop)
I've been working on Infinite Rise for more than a year as a programmer in SACAGAMA.

I learned a lot in the development of the game, learning and integrating important features like **Google Play Services**, **Google Analytics** or **AdMob** was an amazing adventure.

## Projects
These are a few of all the projects I made during my last year in Higher Education Studies (CFGS in spanish).
