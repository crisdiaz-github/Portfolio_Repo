Right now im searching for job offers.

My portfolio will show you a bit of my skills. This will be the base repository and i will link here my Unity works and other little projects.

## Works
#### [Infinite Rise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sacagama.risetothetop)
I've been working on Infinite Rise for more than a year as a programmer in SACAGAMA and its post-launch support.

I learned a lot in the development of the game, learning and integrating important features like **Google Play Services**, **Google Analytics** or **AdMob** was an amazing adventure.
