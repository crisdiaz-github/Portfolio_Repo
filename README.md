# Portfolio
I'm a developer who loves programming and videogames. 

Right now im focused in the post-launch development for the game Rise Top.

My portfolio will show you a bit of my skills. This will be the base repository and i will link here my Unity works and little projects as portfolio.

## Works
#### Rise Top
I've been working on **Rise Top** for more than a year as the only programmer in the team.

I learned a lot in the development of the game, learning and integrating plugins like **Google Play Services**, **Google analytics** or **AdMob** was and amazing adventure.
